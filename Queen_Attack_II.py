You will be given a square chess board with one queen and a number of obstacles 
placed on it. Determine how many squares the queen can attack.

A queen is standing on an N x N  chessboard. The chess board's rows are numbered from 1 to N, 
going from bottom to top. Its columns are numbered from 1 to N, going from left to right. 
Each square is referenced by a tuple (r, c), describing the row,r , and column,c , where 
the square is located.

The queen is standing at position (rq,cq). In a single move, she can attack any square in any of 
the eight directions (left, right, up, down, and the four diagonals). Given the queen's position 
and the locations of all the obstacles, find and print the number of squares the queen can attack 
from her position at (rq,cq).
